About Deep Water
================

Deep Water is a native implementation of Deep Learning models for GPU-optimized backends (MXNet, Caffe, TensorFlow, etc.). You can use Deep Water to create state-of-the-art Deep Learning models trained from the H2O Platform. 

Deep Water behaves just like any other H2O model (Flow, cross-validation, early stopping, hyper-parameter search, etc.), allowing you to train user-defined or pre-defined Deep Learning models for image/text/H2OFrame classification from Flow, R, Python, Java, Scala or REST API. 

You can view a sample of some `Deep Learning Jupyter notebooks <https://github.com/h2oai/h2o-3/tree/master/examples/deeplearning/notebooks>`__ in the H2O repository.
